            <h2>The Itemized Needs Marketplace: How It Works</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Since we are just launching, we are focused on recruiting our first cohort of non-profit partners. This marketplace will soon host tangible needs, ensuring every dollar is accountable.</p>

                    <h3>1. Itemized Needs</h3>
                    <p>Charities post specific items like **"Three new laptops for student tutors"** or **"$200 for event permit fees."** This eliminates ambiguity for donors.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>2. Impact Passport</h3>
                    <p>Donors receive a digital tracker and **photo proof** when the funded item is purchased and delivered. **Trust** is built through radical, real-time accountability.</p>

                    <h3>3. Talent Match</h3>
                    <p>Charities also post needs for **pro-bono student skills** (e.g., social media strategy, flyer design), linking them to our pool of skilled youth volunteers.</p>
